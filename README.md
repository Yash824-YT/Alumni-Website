# Alumni-Website
The Alumni Connection App serves as a foundational platform to engage past graduates  meaningfully. With room for upgrades and rich features, this app can evolve into a powerful  community network over time.

The Alumni Connection Web Application aims to build a digital bridge between alumni and 
their alma mater. This platform provides a centralized system for alumni to register, share 
professional updates, attend events, and contribute to the growth of current students through 
mentorship or networking. The system fosters lifelong connections among graduates while 
keeping them engaged with institutional developments.
